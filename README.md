# Blog_Users
The Blog App is written in three parts: a back-end written in Express NodeJS, a front-end for the content management and another React front-end which is the client/user side.

This is the users front-end, built with React. Users can perform CRUD on their respective comments.

# Blog_API
This is the first of the three parts of the app, it is a RESTful API that allows us to write, store and retrieve the blog's data. It is the Blog app back-end. The source code can be found at [Blog_API](https://github.com/kelshuka/Blog_API.git)

# Content Management System
This is the second part, a React front-end, which gives the admin sole authorization to all CRUD actions on posts.
